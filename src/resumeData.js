        "description":"Immutable data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced memoization and change detection techniques with simple logic. Persistent data presents a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always yields new updated data. Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including: List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record. These data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using structural sharing via hash maps tries and vector tries as popularized by Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data. Immutable.js also provides a lazy Seq, allowing efficient chaining of collection methods like map and filter without creating intermediate representations. Create some Seq with Range and Repeat.",

        "description":`So what exactly is Meteor?
        Meteor is a full stack JavaScript (JS) framework, made up of a collection of libraries and packages, bound together. But some people call Meteor magic.
        
        In a way, it is. Meteor has been built on concepts from other frameworks and libraries in a way that makes it easy to prototype applications. Essentially, it makes web development easier. It’s flexible and requires less code, which means less bugs and typically a higher quality and more stable end result.
        
        Meteor is easy to learn and quick to build with—making it a new favorite for many developers. So what are the top things that make this framework a favorite? Let's take a look at the best reasons to build with Meteor.
